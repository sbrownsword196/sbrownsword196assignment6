        <p>Traveling from the Hudson Valley to Martha's Vineyard, pollinator ecologist Molly Jacobson spends a lot of her time educating communities about their native pollinator problems. Her entire career has been dedicated to solving the ongoing problem of dying bees, and hosting traveling lectures is a big part of that. Another part happens back home in Syracuse, New York, where Jacobson spends her time collecting from nearby nature and then closely studying all manner of bees, butterflies, wasps and moths.</p>

        <p>Research has shown that up to 40% of pollinating species are potentially at risk for extinction due to factors such as pesticide use, habitat destruction and climate change. Every year, in the United States alone, billions of dollars worth of agricultural production depend on pollination.</p>
        
        <p>In April of 2022, the State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry (SUNY-ESF) became an official affiliate of Bee Campus USA–a national initiative in universities and cities across the country focused on conserving the populations of native pollinators–with Jacobson leading the charge as co-chair. Over the past few years, she and her team have worked to make SUNY-ESF's campus a more habitable and attractive place for native pollinators.</p>
        
        <p>Recruiting students to the program was not hard, according to Jacobson. With an entire school dedicated to the study of environmental science, the draw of increased biodiversity on campus through Bee Campus projects was appealing to all sorts of students. Whether they were students focused on botany, or students interested in birds, everyone could benefit from Bee Campus.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section class="content-section">
        <p>Brooke Shaw, a student at SUNY-ESF, met Jacobson after choosing to feature her work for Bee Campus in an environmental journalism class, and after speaking with her, Shaw got a better understanding of the current issues facing native pollinators. She applied for the field technician position soon after.</p>
        
        <p>"I was so impressed, enthralled really, with her work," said Shaw, of Jacobson.</p>
        
        <p>Growing up in a rural part of Vermont, Shaw has always felt a deep love for nature. After taking an environmental science class in high school, she knew she wanted to commit her life to protecting the world around her. Every being deserves a chance at a happy, healthy life, according to Shaw.</p>

        <p>And with that love, Shaw committed herself to the work of Bee Campus. Along with hands-on work collecting pollinators for Jacobson to study, educating others also took up a big part of her time. If she saw students observing the quad meadow or pollinator garden on campus, she would often take a minute to speak with them, and help educate them on the importance of native pollinators.</p>
        
        <p>One project worked on by the members of Bee Campus was the creation of a meadow out of a chunk of SUNY-ESF's main quad. This project was completed under the guidance of Jacobson and Sam Quinn, the Director of Conservation on Private Lands Initiative at SUNY-ESF. Quinn and his team have worked on similar projects in the past within central New York, helping landowners around Skaneateles Lake convert their lawns or land into meadows.</p>
        
        <p>Last year, Jacobson went to Quinn with her idea to turn part of the quad into a meadow. She then worked to figure out what types of plants should be used in order to bring in more native pollinators and overall diversify the ecosystem beyond.</p>
        
        <p>"We collaborate because obviously, I make the habitat for the pollinators she studies," said Quinn.</p>

        <p>The quad meadow project was one of Bee Campus' biggest successes–something that attracted all types of students with all different interests, according to Jacobson. And with the help of team members like Shaw, students visiting this meadow could learn a little more about the conservation efforts of native pollinators, and how the meadow contributes to that.</p>
        
        <p>Just as native pollinators thrive on diversity, so does Bee Campus. Bringing together like-minded individuals connected by their love for the environment has helped establish many pollinator conservation focused projects on and off campus. The program itself follows the principles of ecological diversity Shaw defined–one based in interconnectedness.</p>
